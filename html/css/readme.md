## LESS compiler for MOD-UI's css

Dependencies are all included in package.json. Simply run: 

```shell
sudo npm install
```

And then the "grunt" command and you're set. It should watch every .less and .css file inside the less folder and compile into main.css. Ideally, every section should have its .less file. Bootstrap is included in main.less.
